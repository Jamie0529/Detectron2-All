Icron_water.py is a Icon-water image classification task based on SE-Resnext101,dataset see: . Run icron_water.Py can train and test Icron-water dataset.The loss function visualization program is shown in https://github.com/dongdongdong1217/Detectron2-FC/blob/main/visualizate/Classification/plt_smooth_trainloss.py. The convergence of the loss function in the training process is as follows:
